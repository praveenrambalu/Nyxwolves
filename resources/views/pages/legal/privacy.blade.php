                        href="">Children&rsquo;s Privacy Statement</a> applies to the personal data collected from those
                    applications. If there is a conflict between our Children&rsquo;s Privacy Statement and other
                    sections of our Privacy Statement, this Children&rsquo;s Privacy Statement sets the standard for how
